I've worked 10+ years with data warehouses and related technologies. My main tool is sql - past 3 years in Redshift - but I use other technologies such as Python and bash scripting as needed. Modeling data and applying business logic to raw data is the most fun part of my work. I'm working at Barcelona based [Typeform][typeform], which some day will become a heavyweight European tech company. And it's not exactly lightweight now!

As new ideas pop up I'm going to share some of them in this blog, but there won't be regular posts. I haven't used a single right join during my career, and you shouldn't, either!
